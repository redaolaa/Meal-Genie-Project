### API

The app integrates with TheMealDB API to fetch meal data. This was used from https://www.themealdb.com/api.php?ref=apilist.fun

 The APIs used include:

https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php - Fetches a random meal.
https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=<meal_name> - Searches for meals by name.


### LocalStorage
The app uses localStorage to persist user favorites across sessions. Favorites are stored in JSON format and automatically loaded when the app is opened.







- Saving to Local Storage: The useEffect hook runs whenever the favourites state changes, saving the updated list of favorites to localStorage.
- Retrieving from Local Storage: On initial load, getSavedFavourites fetches the list from localStorage.

### Animation
AOS (Animate on Scroll) is used to create scroll-based animations for meal cards and images.
